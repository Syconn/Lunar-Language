Overview:
    Object Based language, requires type definition, MATH ORIENTATED LANGUAGE?
    Process:
        The Lexer and Parser will consist of a python based program that compiles code in C then create a executable through compiling

Comments:
    #, //, /* */

Operations:
    '+' addition
    '-' subtraction
    '*' multiplication
    '/' division
    '//' integer division
    '**' exponential
    'is / ==' is the same
    'not is / !=' doesn't equal
    'and / &' and
    'or / |' or
    "not / !' not

Control Flow:


Access Modifiers (Optional):
    "locked" = final/locked value
    "local" = protected value
    "accessible" = public value
    "global" static value
    Defaults:
        classes = "locked"
        openfile = "accessible"
         

Primitivies:
    "bool" = tr, fal
    "int" = -1, 0, 1, ...
    "real" = 1, ...
    "float" = 0.1, 0.2, ...
    "str" = "text"

Expressions:
    "definition': <Access Modifier*> identiefier "operation"= identiefier; | null
    "operation": identiefier "operation" identiefier; | value
    "function": "keyword"();

Error:

Core Libraries (MAYBE SOME PREDEFINED NO IMPORT?):
    "Math" = functions like floor, max, min, clamp, sin, cos
    "Vectors" ?
